# Fourth-Year-Project
My fourth year project was on graph colouring. Specifically it was on a type of colouring where each edge can be coloured on each end, with the colour on one end determining the colour on the other. This is called a distortion colouring.

The distortion checker folder contains some programs used to check the distortion colourings of graphs with ease.

The report is my actual fourth year project (although the bibliography is broken, and I can't find the original bibliography file)
